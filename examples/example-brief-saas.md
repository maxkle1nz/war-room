# BRIEF — Example: SaaS MVP Decision

## What
I'm building a project management tool for small creative teams (3-10 people). I need to decide on the MVP scope, tech stack, and go-to-market strategy.

## Goal
Come out of this war room with: a lean MVP spec, a tech stack decision, and a realistic timeline with honest risks.

## Constraints
- Solo founder, $5K budget
- Must ship in 30 days
- Target: freelance designers and small agencies
- Competitors: Notion, Linear, Basecamp

## What I think I know
- Creative teams hate complex tools
- Mobile-first is important
- Pricing should be freemium

## What I'm unsure about
- React Native vs Flutter vs web-only
- Whether to build billing myself or use Stripe
- If 30 days is realistic for a solo dev

## Suggested agents
ARCH, PM, UX, MKT, FINANCE, CHAOS
