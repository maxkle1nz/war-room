### S3: Ignorance Declaration
```
KNOWN:    Current salary, billable rate range for IP associates/partners,
          typical equity buy-in structures, malpractice insurance ranges,
          spouse income as backstop.
UNKNOWN:  Firm's actual profitability and partner distribution model,
          exact equity share offered, client conflict-check outcomes,
          local market saturation for IP boutiques.
ASSUMPTION: Partner distributions at a mid-size firm average $450K–$650K;
            boutique overhead in a mid-tier metro runs $8K–$15K/mo;
            3 portable clients are genuinely portable (no assignment clauses).
```

### Path A: Equity Partner Track

**Capital outlay:**
- Buy-in: $150K (often financed via firm loan at ~5–6%, or personal funds)
- If financed over 5 years: ~$2,830/mo ($34K/yr debt service)

**Projected partner comp (Year 3 onward):**
- Mid-size firm equity partner, IP practice: $450K–$650K total comp
- Midpoint estimate: $550K/yr (salary + distributions)
- Net after buy-in debt service (years 3–7): ~$516K/yr

**5-year cumulative earnings:**
- Years 1–2 (senior associate): $310K × 2 = $620K
- Years 3–5 (partner): $516K × 3 = $1,548K
- **Total: ~$2.17M gross over 5 years**

**Risk factors:** Firm instability (partner exits), buy-in capital at risk if firm dissolves or you leave, distributions not guaranteed.

### Path B: Boutique IP Firm

**Startup costs (Year 1):**

| Item | Annual Cost |
|---|---|
| Office lease (small suite, mid-tier metro) | $36,000 |
| Malpractice insurance (solo IP) | $8,000–$15,000 |
| Bar dues, CLE, licensing | $3,500 |
| Practice management software (Clio/MyCase) | $2,400 |
| Legal research (Westlaw solo plan) | $6,000 |
| Accounting + bookkeeping | $6,000 |
| Marketing + website | $10,000 |
| E&O, general liability | $3,000 |
| Miscellaneous / buffer | $10,000 |
| **Total overhead** | **~$85,000–$92,000/yr** |

**Revenue projection:**
- 3 portable clients: $400K billings (assume 85% collection rate) = $340K collected
- New client development Year 1: conservative $50K additional
- **Year 1 gross revenue: ~$390K**
- **Year 1 net income: ~$298K–$305K** (before taxes)
- Year 2 (growth): $500K gross → ~$410K net
- Year 3 (established): $650K gross → ~$530K net

**Break-even:** Month 3–4 (with portable clients). Without them: Month 10–14.

**5-year cumulative earnings:**
- Year 1: $300K + Year 2: $410K + Year 3: $530K + Year 4: $600K + Year 5: $650K
- **Total: ~$2.49M gross over 5 years**

**Startup capital needed:** $60K–$80K (3 months runway + setup). Household can absorb this from savings given $350K spouse income.

### Cash Flow Stress Test

**Household monthly nut:**
- Mortgage: $4,500
- Living expenses (family of 4): $6,000
- Kids activities/education: $2,000
- Insurance (health via spouse's employer): $0 incremental
- Taxes (estimated quarterly): set aside 30%
- **Minimum monthly household need: ~$12,500**

Spouse covers $21,500/mo net (after taxes on $350K). **The household survives even if the boutique earns $0 for 6 months.** This is the single most important financial fact in this war room.

### S1: Opposite Test
```
DECISION:  Path B (boutique) is financially superior over 5 years.
OPPOSITE:  Path A (partner) is financially superior.
STEEL-MAN: Partner comp is guaranteed income with no startup risk,
           firm-funded infrastructure, and the buy-in appreciates as
           equity. A bad year at the boutique could mean $0; a bad
           year at the firm still pays $450K+.
WHY THIS:  The $2.49M vs $2.17M gap widens every year after Year 3.
           The spouse income eliminates the downside tail risk that
           makes the steel-man compelling. The buy-in is DEAD capital
           if the firm collapses — and two partners just left.
```

## 3. LEGAL AGENT

### S3: Ignorance Declaration
```
KNOWN:    General non-compete enforceability trends, ABA Model Rules
          on client solicitation, malpractice insurance market ranges,
          entity formation options.
UNKNOWN:  Specific STATE governing this non-compete (enforceability
          varies enormously), exact non-compete language (is it
          non-compete or non-solicitation?), whether clients have
          engagement letters with the firm or the attorney.
ASSUMPTION: Jurisdiction is a state that permits reasonable non-competes
            for attorneys (not CA, CO, MN, ND, OK — which ban them).
            ABA Model Rule 5.6 applies.
```

### Non-Compete Enforceability

**Critical distinction:** Attorney non-competes occupy a unique legal space.

- **ABA Model Rule 5.6:** "A lawyer shall not participate in offering or making a partnership, shareholders, operating, employment, or other similar type of agreement that restricts the right of a lawyer to practice after termination of the relationship." Most states have adopted this or a variant.
- **Practical reality:** Even in states that nominally enforce non-competes, courts apply heightened scrutiny to attorney agreements because they restrict *client choice* — a constitutional and ethical concern.
- **The "financial penalty" workaround:** Some firms structure it as a financial disincentive (forfeiture of deferred comp) rather than an injunction. Courts are split — *Whiteside v. Griffis & Griffis* (Tex. 2010) upheld financial penalties; *Meehan v. Shaughnessy* (Mass. 1989) limited them.

**Assessment:** The 1-year, 50-mile non-compete is likely **unenforceable as written** against an attorney in the majority of jurisdictions. Even if technically enforceable, injunctive relief is rarely granted — damages are the typical remedy, and proving damages when clients *chose* to leave is extremely difficult.

**Recommendation:** Obtain a formal legal opinion from an employment attorney in your jurisdiction *before* giving notice. Budget $3,000–$5,000 for this. It's the highest-ROI spend in this entire decision.

### Client Solicitation — Ethical Obligations

- **ABA Model Rule 7.3:** Prohibits real-time solicitation of prospective clients when a significant motive is pecuniary gain. However, *current and former clients* are exempt — you may notify them of your departure.
- **The departure letter:** You are ethically **required** to notify clients you actively serve that you are leaving. This is not solicitation; it is discharge of fiduciary duty. The client then *chooses* their attorney.
- **Firm protocol:** Most partnership agreements require a joint notification letter (firm + departing attorney). Negotiate this. The language matters — "Attorney X is leaving; you may stay with the firm, follow Attorney X, or choose any attorney" is standard.
- **Do NOT contact clients before giving notice to the firm.** This is the single most litigated aspect of attorney departures (*Meehan v. Shaughnessy*).

### Entity Formation

- **Recommended: PLLC** (Professional Limited Liability Company) in most states.
  - Pass-through taxation (no double taxation).
  - Limited liability for business debts (NOT for malpractice — that's always personal).
  - Simpler than a PC (Professional Corporation).
- Register with the state bar as a law firm entity.
- Obtain EIN, IOLTA trust account (mandatory), operating account.
- Timeline: 2–4 weeks in most states.

### Malpractice Insurance

- Solo IP practitioner: $8,000–$15,000/yr for $1M/$3M coverage.
- **Prior acts coverage (tail insurance):** Confirm whether the current firm's policy covers work done while employed. If not, purchase a tail — ~$5,000–$10,000 one-time.
- IP-specific risk: Patent prosecution errors have long tails (patent term is 20 years). Ensure policy covers patent prosecution if applicable.

## 4. PM AGENT (Career Strategist)

### H2: Ripple Analysis — Path A (Partner Track)
```
DECISION:  Accept equity partnership in 2 years.
ORDER 1:   Financial stability maintained; $150K buy-in committed.
ORDER 2:   Locked into firm culture and politics for 5–10+ years;
           burnout accelerates — partners bill 1,800–2,000 but carry
           management, BD, and mentoring obligations adding 500+ hrs.
ORDER 3:   At 45, deeply embedded in firm identity. Leaving later
           means higher exit cost (larger capital at risk, deeper
           client entanglement, golden handcuffs). Optionality decays
           exponentially.
VERDICT:   Path A trades short-term safety for long-term rigidity.
```

### H2: Ripple Analysis — Path B (Boutique Firm)
```
DECISION:  Launch boutique IP firm.
ORDER 1:   Income dip Year 1 (~$300K vs ~$310K). Stress of startup.
           Freedom to set own hours and client selection.
ORDER 2:   By Year 3, earning more than partner track with fewer hours.
           Building an ASSET (a firm with enterprise value) vs. renting
           a seat. Can hire associates, create leverage.
ORDER 3:   At 45, owns a practice worth 0.5–1.5× gross revenue on sale.
           Can sell, merge, or wind down on own terms. Kids see
           entrepreneurial model. Burnout resets — autonomy is the
           #1 predictor of professional satisfaction (Karasek demand-
           control model).
VERDICT:   Path B trades short-term discomfort for long-term freedom.
```

### 5-Year Career Trajectory Comparison

| Year | Path A (Partner) | Path B (Boutique) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Senior associate, same grind | Launch. Hustle. Learn ops. |
| 2 | Senior associate → partner vote | Stabilize. 2–3 new clients. |
| 3 | Junior partner, learning politics | $500K+ revenue. Hire paralegal. |
| 4 | Building book, firm obligations | Hire first associate. Leverage. |
| 5 | Mid-tier partner, $550K–$650K | $700K+ revenue, $500K+ take-home |

### Burnout Risk Assessment

**Current state:** 2,200 billable hours = ~2,800 actual hours worked (1.3× multiplier for non-billable). That's 54 hours/week, 50 weeks/year. Classic burnout trajectory.

**Path A burnout forecast:** Partner hours don't decrease — they *shift*. Less pure billable, more BD/management/committee work. Total hours: 2,500–2,800. Plus the psychological weight of $150K at risk in a firm losing partners.

**Path B burnout forecast:** Year 1 is harder (everything is you). Years 2+ are *controllable*. Solo practitioners report higher satisfaction despite similar hours because of *autonomy* — you choose your clients, your hours, your cases. Target: 1,600–1,800 billable hours, $400+ effective rate.

### Lifestyle Impact

- **Schedule control:** Path B wins decisively. School pickups, soccer games, family dinner — you set the calendar.
- **Financial stress:** Minimal given spouse income. Path B's variance is absorbable.
- **Identity:** "Founding partner of own firm" vs. "partner at [firm name]." Both carry weight; B carries *your* name.

## 5. CHAOS AGENT

### Attacking Path A: The Partner Track Is a Trap

The firm just lost **two partners**. You are not being *promoted*. You are being **recruited to backfill a sinking ship.** Questions nobody is asking:

1. **Why did the partners leave?** If they saw deteriorating economics, you're buying equity in a depreciating asset. Did you see the firm's financials? Have you *asked*?
2. **$150K buy-in for what?** What is the firm's revenue per equity partner? What are the distributions? If they won't show you audited financials before you write a $150K check, that tells you everything.
3. **"Equity partner in 2 years" is not a promise.** It's a maybe. Partnership votes fail. Goalposts move. What happens to your $150K if the vote doesn't go your way? Read the partnership agreement — the clawback terms, the withdrawal penalties, the non-compete triggers.
4. **The real math of partner hours:** Partners don't work less. They work *more* — but on things that don't bill. Committee meetings, associate reviews, lateral recruiting, client entertainment. You're trading billable burnout for political burnout.

**CHAOS rating for Path A: 4/10.** You're buying a seat on a bus that's losing its drivers.

### Attacking Path B: The Boutique Fantasy

Everybody thinks they'll be the next Wachtell. Most solo IP practitioners plateau at $300K–$500K and work alone forever. Reality check:

1. **"3 loyal clients who'd follow"** — Have you actually *asked* them? Loyalty is tested at the moment of decision, not before. One Fortune 500 GC saying "we need to stay with the firm for risk management" and your $400K projection drops to $200K.
2. **You've never run a business.** Payroll, trust accounting, IT, HR, marketing, collections — these are skills you don't have and haven't priced. The psychic overhead of being a CEO *and* a practitioner breaks people.
3. **The non-compete might not be enforceable, but the litigation is real.** Your old firm doesn't need to *win* the non-compete suit. They just need to *file* it, notify your clients, and create enough FUD to freeze your pipeline for 6 months. Budget $50K–$100K in legal defense costs and 6 months of disrupted revenue.
4. **IP law is consolidating, not fragmenting.** Big clients want big firms for patent litigation. Boutiques thrive on prosecution and counseling — is that where your $400K in client billings comes from?

**CHAOS rating for Path B: 6/10.** Better than A, but romanticized. The execution risk is real.

### Option C: The One Nobody Mentioned

**Join one of the partners who just left.**

If two partners departed, they went somewhere — another firm, or they started their own practice. You have leverage:

- You bring $400K in portable business
- You have 8 years of IP expertise
- You eliminate their recruitment cost
- You negotiate from strength (partner-level comp, equity stake, no buy-in or reduced buy-in)

**This gives you:** firm infrastructure without startup cost, partnership without $150K risk, mentorship from senior partners who already made the leap, and a built-in answer to the non-compete ("I was recruited, not soliciting").

**CHAOS rating for Option C: 7.5/10.** Explore before committing to A or B.

### Counter-Proposal

**Execute in sequence, not in parallel:**
1. **Week 1–2:** Quietly contact the departed partners. Explore Option C.
2. **If Option C is viable:** Negotiate. You're in the strongest position you'll ever be in.
3. **If Option C is dead:** Execute Path B, but with a 90-day preparation phase *while still employed*. Set up the PLLC, secure malpractice insurance, build the website, line up the office — all legal, all on your own time.
4. **Path A is the default only if B and C both fail.** And even then, demand to see audited firm financials before writing a $150K check.

---

## 6. CONSOLIDATED DECISION

### The Verdict: Path B (Boutique), with Option C as first exploration

**Sequence:** Explore C → Execute B → Accept A only as last resort.

### S1: Opposite Test
```
DECISION:  Leave the firm. Launch boutique (or join departed partners).
OPPOSITE:  Stay and make partner.
STEEL-MAN: Partnership offers guaranteed $450K+ income, institutional
           support, established brand, no startup risk, and a proven
           career trajectory. The capital buy-in builds equity in a
           going concern. Spouse income makes the $150K painless. Two
           partner departures could mean OPPORTUNITY — less competition
           for the remaining equity pool.
WHY THIS:  The steel-man assumes the firm is healthy. Two partner exits
           is a red flag, not an opportunity. The buy-in is illiquid and
           at-risk capital in a firm showing instability. The burnout
           trajectory is unsustainable. And the single most powerful
           factor: with $350K spouse income, the downside of Path B is
           a modest pay cut in Year 1, while the upside is uncapped
           income, asset creation, and autonomy. The risk-reward is
           asymmetric in favor of leaving.
```

### S3: Ignorance Declaration
```
KNOWN:    Household can survive on spouse income alone.
          Non-competes for attorneys are disfavored in most states.
          IP boutiques with portable clients can break even in 90 days.
UNKNOWN:  Why the two partners actually left.
          Whether the 3 clients will genuinely follow.
          The firm's real financial health.
ASSUMPTION: Clients are portable (no firm-level engagement locks).
            The non-compete won't survive a challenge.
            The departed partners would entertain a conversation.
```

### A4: Pre-Mortem — How This Fails
```
FAILURE 1: Clients don't follow. Revenue is $150K, not $400K.
MITIGATION: Have the conversation with clients BEFORE giving notice.
            Not solicitation — general relationship temperature check.
            "How important is it to you who handles your work?"

FAILURE 2: Former firm sues on non-compete, freezing operations.
MITIGATION: Employment counsel opinion FIRST. Budget $50K defense
            reserve. Structure departure to minimize provocation
            (cooperative transition, joint client letter).

FAILURE 3: Burnout doesn't improve — it shifts to startup stress.
MITIGATION: Hire a virtual assistant and bookkeeper from Day 1.
            Outsource everything that isn't legal work. Set a hard
            cap of 1,800 billable hours/yr. The whole point is
            autonomy — exercise it.
```

### A1: Via Negativa — What to Remove
```
1. REMOVE the assumption you must decide now. You have months.
   The partner track offer doesn't expire tomorrow. Use the time.
2. REMOVE the binary framing. Option C exists. So does Option D
   (lateral to a better firm with no buy-in). Explore before committing.
3. REMOVE the emotional weight of "loyalty" to the current firm.
   They are offering you a BUSINESS DEAL, not a favor. Evaluate it
   as a business deal — demand financials, model the returns, negotiate
   the terms. If they won't show you the books, that's your answer.
```

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

| Priority | Action | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Retain employment counsel for non-compete opinion | This week |
| 2 | Discreetly contact departed partners (Option C) | Weeks 1–3 |
| 3 | Temperature-check portable clients | Weeks 2–4 |
| 4 | Request firm financial disclosure (if considering Path A) | Week 4 |
| 5 | If C viable → negotiate and transition | Months 2–3 |
| 6 | If C dead, clients confirmed portable → execute Path B | Months 2–4 |
| 7 | Path A only if B and C both fail AND firm financials are strong | Month 4+ |

**The asymmetry is clear.** A $350K spouse income transforms this from a high-stakes gamble into a calculated career move with a soft landing. The downside is a modest, temporary pay cut. The upside is financial independence, professional autonomy, and an exit from a burnout trajectory that will, if unchecked, cost more than money.

Don't buy a seat on a bus that's losing its drivers. Build your own vehicle.
