# BRIEF — Example: Career Decision

## What
I'm a senior engineer at a big tech company considering leaving to start my own startup. I need a structured analysis of this decision.

## Goal
An honest assessment of: should I stay or go? What's the real risk? What's the timeline to first revenue? What am I not seeing?

## Constraints
- 12 months of savings (runway)
- Partner is supportive but nervous
- Non-compete clause (6 months, same industry)
- The startup idea is in developer tools

## What I think I know
- Developer tools market is growing
- I have domain expertise
- My network could be first customers

## What I'm unsure about
- Whether my savings are actually enough
- If the non-compete is enforceable
- Whether I'm romanticizing the startup life

## Suggested agents
FINANCE, LEGAL, PM, RESEARCH, CHAOS
